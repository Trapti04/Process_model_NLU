The Loan Coordinator will partner with you to schedule your closing date and will ensure all ownership documents are conveyed accurately at the FAA. Prior to processing any change or creation request, a hardcopy printout should be made of the request. Manual notes are made on this document (see procedure below) and consequently this document is archived. In some instances the annotated document is also scanned first. All requests submitted by the VMD clerk will be reviewed by the RAMSES team. Once reviewed, the VMD clerk will receive a response. Either the request will be approved, or not. If the request is not approved this will be either because mistakes were made in the details entered, or because the change/creation should not be executed at all. In all cases, the response from the RAMSES team will provide instructions on how to proceed. Together, these define the Zilog Quality Management System. The Quality Manual is reviewed, revised and approved at least annually or as needed. The Quality Control department is responsible for establishing, maintaining and implementing the Quality Manual. Personnel authorized to initiate changes to the Quality Manual are the QC Manager, the Internal Auditor, and the Document Controlled Officers with approval of the General Managers
