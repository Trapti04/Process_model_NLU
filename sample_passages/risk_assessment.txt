If the risk assessment affirms that the event poses a serious public health risk, the Emergency Meeting will also assign an event manager to decide whether to activate the SHOC and PHE response at this time. Develop an agenda for the first teleconference involving AFRO, the CO, IST and HQ. Decide on the teleconference chair and who will be responsible for taking the minutes of the meeting. Assign a team member from the Event Management Team to contact the CO requesting any additional information needed to inform the risk assessment and response options in advance of the first joint teleconference. Identify the teams and disciplines from each level of WHO required at the teleconference (the global event management team). The composition of the team will depend on the nature and scale of the PHE.
